# Arma Reforger HOTAS Configurator

A browser-based configurator for setting up HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) controls in Arma Reforger.

## Features

- **Browser-Based**: No installation required - runs entirely in your web browser
- **Joystick Detection**: Automatically detects connected joysticks and game controllers
- **Interactive Configuration**: Walk through each action and assign buttons/axes
- **HAT Switch Support**: Special detection mode for HAT switches and POV controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time display of configured actions with progress tracking
- **Config Generation**: Generates Arma Reforger-compatible `.conf` files
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically names config files based on your joystick
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys and clickable actions for easy configuration editing

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Connect your HOTAS/joystick
3. Click **"Start Configuring"**
4. Follow the prompts to assign each action
5. Press **SPACE** to confirm each input
6. Download your config when complete

## Installation

### Save Location

After downloading your config file, save it to:

```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforger\profile\.save\settings\customInputConfigs
```

Or on Linux:
```
~/.local/share/bohemia interactive/arma reforger/profile/.save/settings/customInputConfigs
```

## Usage

### Configuring Actions

1. **Press or move** a button/axis on your joystick
2. **Press SPACE** to confirm the detected input
3. Use **↑/↓ arrows** to navigate between actions
4. Click any action in the list to jump to it
5. Use **Skip** to skip an action
6. Use **Clear Binding** to remove a binding

### HAT Mode

Enable **HAT Mode** for difficult HAT switches that behave unexpectedly. This uses simplified detection for discrete axis inputs.

### Resume Feature

If you navigate backward, a **Resume** button appears to jump back to where you left off.
